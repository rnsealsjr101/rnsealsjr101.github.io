<h2><span id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span id="History">History</span></h3>
<p>As a child, Takahashi liked to draw, but did not start putting manga together until he was in high school.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>When he was 19, one of Takahashi's manga stories won a contest in  a shonen manga magazine. He considers that to be his debut, but for the  next ten years he went through several publishers and had a lot of  rejected stories.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi worked for a game company, but aspired to create manga.  In 1990, he managed to create 100 pages of manga and 200 pages of  sketches before bringing his first proposal to <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump" title="Weekly Shōnen Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a></em>.  The editor he met was bothered by the size of his submission, but read  through all of it and understood that Takahashi wanted to do a battle  story. In the end that manga idea was rejected.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>His first work was <em>Tokio no Tsuma</em>, published in 1990. One of his earliest works was <em>Tennenshokudanji Buray</em> (天然色男児BURAY), which lasted for two volumes and was published from 1991  to 1992. Takahashi didn't find success until 1996 when he created <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>. </p>
<p>Takahashi's  popular <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> manga started the creation of the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, known within the series as <em>Magic and Wizards</em> and later <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_Monsters" title="Duel Monsters">Duel Monsters</a></em>.  However, he never intended to focus his manga on the card game he  created. The original format of the manga was set in episodic chapters  with a different game being played in each chapter, and the Magic and  Wizards card game was originally intended to only appear in two  chapters. Shueisha, the publisher of the <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump" title="Weekly Shōnen Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a></em> magazine, received so many letters and fan-mail asking about the <em>Magic and Wizards</em> game that Takahashi decided to extend it.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi had promised himself that <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_GX" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! GX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> would be the last <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series. However, he was approached at the end of 2006 with the idea for <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_5D%27s" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>. The production staff and TV board were long time associates and friends, who had spread <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> to many people in the world, so Takahashi agreed, under the condition that this would be the last <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-4">[4]</a> Despite this, four subsequent series, <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_ZEXAL" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>, <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_ARC-V" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_VRAINS" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_SEVENS" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS">Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS</a></em> have been made. </p>
<p>Takahashi compiled various <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> illustrations he'd drawn into the book <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_Art" title="Duel Art">Duel Art</a></em> which was published on December 16, 2011.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-shueisha-5">[5]</a></p>
<p>After <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, Takahashi designed <em>Advent Heroes</em>, a comic and card game, influenced by American comics.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In 2018, he wrote a short-form manga called <em>The COMIQ</em>, about a mangaka whose work is magical.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-7">[7]</a> It will be published in <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump" title="Weekly Shōnen Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a> in Japanese and English.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi had varying degrees of involvement in the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> franchise&rsquo;s movies. For many of them, his main contribution was being the creator of the original manga and in the case of <em>Pyramid of Light</em> the design of the movie&rsquo;s main villain Anubis. For the anime&rsquo;s tenth anniversary movie <em>Bonds Beyond Time</em>, he also provided key animation of the scene where Yami Yugi draws a card at the beginning of his turn. <em>The Dark Side of Dimensions</em> saw the most direct involvement from Takahashi. Though the movie was  planned before he joined the project, he soon became the movie&rsquo;s  executive producer, story designer, character designer, and scriptwriter  after the producer invited him to write it. The scene of Yugi donning  the new Duel Disk and inserting his Deck into it before facing Aigami  was personally animated by Takahashi himself. </p>
<h3><span id="Influences">Influences</span></h3>
<p>Takahashi has mentioned a number of things which may have inspired him to become a mangaka. One of them was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamishibai" title="wikipedia:Kamishibai">kamishibai</a> he used to enjoy going to when he attended elementary school. During  the show, he would wonder if the old man hosting it, drew all the  pictures himself.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-9">[9]</a> Another was an event that occurred in his first year of high school. An  unfriendly teacher compared him to a defecating machine in front of the  class. His classmates laughed, but he thought to himself that a  defecating machine could not create comics.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi decided to use battle as his primary theme. However  there had been so much &quot;fighting&quot; manga, he found it difficult to come  up with something original. He decided to create a fighting manga, where  the main character doesn't hit anybody, but struggled with that  limitation. However when the word &quot;game&quot; came to mind, he found it much  easier to work with.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi had always been interested in games. He claims to have  been obsessed as a kid and still interested in them as an adult. In the  games he considered the player to become a hero. He decided to base the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series around such games and used this idea as the premises; Yugi was a  weak childish boy, who became a hero when he played games.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>He admits that it is difficult to come up with many unique  monsters. He tries to fit the player's characteristics into the creature  he is creating, such as giving <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Seto_Kaiba" title="Seto Kaiba">Seto Kaiba</a> vicious cards to suit his personality.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>With friendship being one of the major themes of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, he based the names of the two major characters &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yugi_Muto" title="Yugi Muto">Yūgi</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Joey_Wheeler" title="Joey Wheeler">Jōnouchi</a>&quot; on the word <em>yūjō</em> (友情), which means &quot;friendship&quot;.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henshin" title="wikipedia:Henshin">Henshin</a>,  the ability to turn into something or someone else, is something  Takahashi believed all children dreamed of. He considered Yugi's henshin <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yami_Yugi" title="Yami Yugi">Yami Yugi</a>, a savvy, invincible games player, to be a big appeal to children.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-tfk-1">[1]</a> The character Seto Kaiba is partly based on an arrogant collectible card game player Takashashi heard of.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Before writing the original <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shadi" title="Shadi">Shadi</a> storyline, Takahashi visited Egypt to gather information.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi was ill at the time of writing the Pharaoh's memory  arc. He ended up in the hospital and struggled to meet deadlines. As a  result, he reluctantly cut short <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Priest_Seto" title="Priest Seto">Priest Seto</a> and <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kisara" title="Kisara">Kisara</a>'s story, which he regrets as it was to explain the relationship between Seto Kaiba and the &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon" title="Blue-Eyes White Dragon">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a>&quot;. He also joked that the design of <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Zorc_Necrophades" title="Zorc Necrophades">Zorc Necrophades</a> was due to his grogginess at the time.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Sometime during the original run of the pre-Trading Card manga,  Takahashi had his handbag stolen by a thief during a night when he  played Pachinko. The thief was never caught and included in his bag were  further ideas for stories for the originating manga; he expressed some  desire to recall and remember the ideas that were lost since. </p>
<p>He credits his unmet expectations from seeing <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazinger_Z_vs._Devilman" title="wikipedia:Mazinger Z vs. Devilman">Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman</a></em> in his childhood as an inspiration for the film <em><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_VS._GX" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! VS. GX">Yu-Gi-Oh! VS. GX</a></em>. Although the film wasn't made, elements from it were used in the second season of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Takahashi personally created, among other monsters, &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Magician" title="Dark Magician">Dark Magician</a>&quot;, the &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Heroes" title="Elemental Heroes">Elemental Heroes</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Junk_Synchron" title="Junk Synchron">Junk Synchron</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon" title="Stardust Dragon">Stardust Dragon</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Dragon_Archfiend" title="Red Dragon Archfiend">Red Dragon Archfiend</a>&quot; (another of his &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser" title="wikipedia:Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>&quot; inspirations besides &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo" title="Jinzo">Jinzo</a>&quot;), and &quot;<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Number_39:_Utopia" title="Number 39: Utopia">Number 39: Utopia</a>&quot;.  As expected, he also created and hand drew the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> protagonists (<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yugi_Muto" title="Yugi Muto">Yugi Muto</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yami_Yugi" title="Yami Yugi">Yami Yugi</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jaden_Yuki" title="Jaden Yuki">Jaden Yuki</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yusei_Fudo" title="Yusei Fudo">Yusei Fudo</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuma_Tsukumo" title="Yuma Tsukumo">Yuma Tsukumo</a>) as well as several key characters. </p>
<p>He also created <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_artwork" title="Alternate artwork">alternate artworks</a> for some cards like <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon" title="Blue-Eyes White Dragon">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Black_Dragon" title="Red-Eyes Black Dragon">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Magician" title="Dark Magician">Dark Magician</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Summoned_Skull" title="Summoned Skull">Summoned Skull</a>, <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo" title="Jinzo">Jinzo</a>, the <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Egyptian_Gods" title="Egyptian Gods">Egyptian Gods</a>, etc., which he signed. </p>
<h2><span id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Takahashi likes to play games, such as Shogi (Japanese chess),<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-16">[16]</a> Mahjong (the traditional Chinese tile game), card games, and tabletop role playing games. </p>
<p>Takahashi considers himself to be a procrastinator. He doesn't  work until close to a deadline, at which point he always ask himself why  he didn't start working earlier.<a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuki_Takahashi#cite_note-17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Takahashi and Mike Mignola, the creator of the <em>Hellboy</em> comic book series, once participated in an art exchange. Takahashi, who  is a fan of American comics, drew a picture of Hellboy with Yugi Mutou's  hairdo, the Millennium Puzzle, and a Duel Disk. Mignola drew a picture  of Hellboy wearing the Millennium Puzzle and a Yugi t-shirt, and the two  exchanged their artworks. He also collaborated with Yoshio Sawai by  sending him a picture of Yugi that was used in the manga <em>Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</em> (Bobobo makes Yugi come out of his afro). In return, Takahashi included the 'nu' handkerchief in one of the panels in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> during the Egypt arc. </p>
